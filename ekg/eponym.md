# Romano-Ward Syndrome (1963)

--

Congenital (autosomal dominant) long QT syndrome (LQTS).

- Unlike Jervell-Lange-Nielsen, there is no congenital hearing loss present
- Multiple genetic mutations identified linked to cardiac potassium and beta-adrenergic channels.
- Mainstay of treatment is beta-blockers.
- Risk of sudden cardiac death â€“ if any syncope or sustained ventricular arrhythmias for ablation / ICD implantation.

# Jervell and Lange-Nielsen Syndrome (1957)

--

Congenital (autosomal recessive) long QT syndrome (LQTS)

- *Associated with severe, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.
- Two genetic mutations identified encoding cardiac potassium channels.
- Due to high risk of sudden cardiac death ICD implantation is usually required

# Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (1930)

--

Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome is a combination of the presence of a congenital accessory pathway and episodes of tachyarrhythmia.

WPW syndrome is characterized by a double stimulation of the ventricles. A premature conduction wave via accessory pathways (pre-excitation) stimulates the portions of the ventricles nearest the atrium; then the ventricles depolarize as a result of the conduction wave which proceeds normally through the atrioventricular (AV) node.

The clinical significance of this syndrome depends on the appearance of (supraventricular) reentry tachycardias.

# Bornholm disease (1930)

--

Acute, transient viral myositis associated with Coxsackie B

- Viral myositis involving the intercostal and abdominal muscles characterized by fever and sharp, spasmodic pain in the chest wall or abdomen.
- This syndrome is sometimes preceded by a moderate to severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and pharyngitis. The illness is most common in children and adolescents and usually lasts 3 to 5 days.
- Local outbreaks of pleurodynia with high infection rates within affected households have occurred, and major epidemics can take place every 10 to 20 years

# Da Costa Syndrome (1871)

--

Symptom-complex characterized by palpitation, dyspnea, precordial pain, fatigue, exaggerated emotional responses with increased cardiac awareness, and occasionally, systolic hypertension
