Atrial fibrillation with 3rd degree AV block and a junctional escape rhythm (“regularised AF”)

- Coarse atrial fibrillation (irregular baseline with atrial complexes at rate > 400 bpm).
- Regular narrow complex rhythm at 60 bpm.
- The combination of atrial fibrillation with a regular rhythm (“regularised AF”) indicates that none of the atrial impulses are conducted to the ventricles, i.e. complete heart block is present.
- The narrow complex rhythm is therefore a junctional escape rhythm.
- Regularised AF is characteristically seen as a consequence of digoxin toxicity.

Sinus arrest with a ventricular escape rhythm

- Sinus pause / arrest (there is a single P wave visible on the 6-second rhythm strip).
- Broad complex escape rhythm with a LBBB morphology at a rate of 25 bpm.
- The LBBB morphology (dominant S wave in V1) suggests a ventricular escape rhythm arising from the right bundle branch.

Complete heart block with a ventricular escape rhythm

- Sinus rhythm with 3rd degree AV block.
- Broad complex escape rhythm at around 27 bpm.
- The RBBB (dominant R wave in V1) + left posterior fascicular block (right axis deviation) morphology suggests a ventricular escape rhythm arising from the left anterior fascicle.

Complete heart block with a ventricular escape rhythm

- Sinus rhythm with 3rd degree AV block.
- Extremely slow broad complex escape rhythm (around 15 bpm).
- The RBBB morphology (dominant R wave in V1) indicates a ventricular escape rhythm arising somewhere within the left bundle branch.

De Winter T waves

- Upsloping ST depression in the precordial leads (> 1mm at J-point).
- Peaked anterior T waves (V2-6), with the ascending limb of the T wave commencing below the isoelectric baseline.
- Subtle ST elevation in aVR > 0.5mm.

_There is also some high lateral involvement, with subtle ST elevation in aVL plus reciprocal change in III + aVF. This is consistent with LAD occlusion occurring proximal to the 1st diagonal._

De Winter T waves (Morphing into Anterior STEMI)

This great ECG demonstrates de Winter’s T waves combined with features of anterior STEMI — the patient ultimately turned out to have an acute proximal LAD occlusion.

- Upsloping ST depression and peaked T waves (De Winter’s T waves) in V3-6.
- ST elevation in the septal (V1-2) and high lateral leads (I & aVL) with inferior reciprocal change, consistent with an LAD occlusion proximal to the 1st diagonal.

Positive Sgarbossa criteria in a patient with LBBB and troponin-positive myocardial infarction:

- This patient presented with chest pain and had elevated cardiac enzymes.
- Baseline ECG showed typical LBBB.
- There is 1mm concordant ST elevation in aVL (= 5 points).
- Other features on this ECG that are abnormal in the context of LBBB (but not considered “positive” Sgarbossa criteria) are the pathological Q wave in lead I and the concordant ST depression in the inferior leads III and aVF.
- This constellation of abnormalities suggests to me that the patient was having a high lateral infarction.

Positive Sgarbossa criteria in a patient with a ventricular paced rhythm:

- There is concordant ST depression in V2-5 (= Sgarbossa positive).
- The morphology in V2-5 is reminiscent of posterior STEMI, with horizontal ST depression and prominent upright T waves.
- This patient had a confirmed posterior infarction, requiring PCI to a completely occluded posterolateral branch of the RCA.

Wellens Syndrome (Type A Pattern)

- Biphasic precordial T waves with terminal negativity, most prominent in V2-3.
- Minor precordial ST elevation.
- Preserved R wave progression (R wave in V3 > 3mm)

Wellens Syndrome (Type A Pattern)

- The biphasic T waves in V2-3 are characteristic of Wellens syndrome.

Wellens Syndrome (Type B Pattern)

- There are deep, symmetrical T wave inversions throughout the anterolateral leads (V1-6, I, aVL).

Wellens Syndrome (Type A Pattern)

- Biphasic T waves with minimal ST elevation in V1-5, consistent with Wellens syndrome.
- The patient had experienced ischaemic chest pain immediately prior to arrival in hospital and was pain free at the time the ECG was taken.

As ECG expert Steve Smith from Dr Smith’s ECG Blog pointed out in a recent email to me, this ECG is more consistent with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism!

Note the following features:

- Tachycardia (~100bpm)
- Rightward axis (+90)
- T wave inversions in the right precordial leads (V1-4) plus lead III
- The ST / T-wave morphology is identical to this example of pulmonary embolism

Apologies for the misinformation… As you can see, these two conditions can be difficult to tell apart!

This is an example of Pseudo-Wellens syndrome due to left ventricular hypertrophy

ECG Review

- LVH by voltage criteria (SV1 + RV6 > 35mm)
- The pattern of inverted and biphasic T waves is different to Wellens syndrome, affecting multiple leads (i.e. any lead with a tall R wave) rather than V2-3.
- In this case, the Wellens-like T waves are just a variant on the repolarisation abnormality (LV “strain”pattern) that is seen with LVH.

This pattern of T wave changes:

- Is most commonly seen in the lateral leads (V5-6, I, aVL).
- Typically occurs in patients with high QRS voltages, e.g. due to LVH, or in young black males with benign early repolarization.
